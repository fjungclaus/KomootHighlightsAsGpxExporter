# "Komoot Highlights as Gpx"-Exporter

## Description
* This is a small Tampermonkey userscript to export your Komoot tour highlights as waypoints within a GPX file. 
* The exported GPX file can be imported in Garmin BaseCamp or Garmin devices. I've tested this with an Oregon 600, a Fenix 6 and a Edge 1000+.
* Might also run with Greasmonkey in Firefox, but I didn't find the time to test that until now ...
* There is also the possibility to export the Komoot highlights as comma separated values, to be imported in programs like OpenOffice Calc. This might be used to create roadbooks, etc.

## Todos
* Have distance across the track of the highlights in the waypoint and CSV
* Allow exporting waypoints plus the GPX track itself in a single GPX file
* Finish code for CSV export
* About page
* Help page
* Upload some screen shots to Github
